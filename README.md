# RIv1.0 Dashboard

This repository contains a simple web page that displays a real-time clock and a background color that changes every second.

## Usage

Open `dashboard.html` in a web browser. The page will automatically update the displayed time and background color every second.

If you prefer to serve the page with a local web server, you can use Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html` in your browser.
